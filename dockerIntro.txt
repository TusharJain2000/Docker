1. Docker is a platform facilitating the creation, deployment, and execution of applications through containers.

2. Containers package applications along with their dependencies into standardized units for seamless software development.

3. Docker enables developers to build, deploy, and manage applications consistently across various environments, like development, 
testing, and production.

4. Applications can be run on any platform supporting Docker containers, be it a laptop, data center, or cloud infrastructure.

5. Docker leverages containerization technology to offer lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments for applications.

6. Components of Docker include Docker Engine for container management, Docker Hub for sharing container images, 
and Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container applications.

7. Docker streamlines the development and deployment process by ensuring a consistent environment, reducing dependency conflicts,
and enhancing scalability and resource utilization.

8.Each application is run in an isolated enviroment (Containers)


<--------------------------------------------- Containers Vs Virtual Machines -------------------------------------------------->

                        Container                           |                               Virtual Machines
                                                            |
1) An isolated enviroment for running an application        |   An abstraction of a Machine(Physical Hardware). Therefore, We can
                                                            |   run several Virtual Machines on a single real Physical Machine.
                                                            |
2)  lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments. |   Uses Hypervisors. Each VM needs a full blown OS
    Uses OS of the host.                                    |
                                                            |   
3) Comparatively Faster then VM                             |   Slow to start
                                                            |
4) Needs Less Hardware resources as it uses the host's OS   |   Resource intensive as each VM needs/takes a slice of actual
                                                            |    physical hardware resources
                                                            |
5) Provides OS-level process isolation                      |   Provide Hardware level process isolation and are slow to boot

Note: *Docker uses a Client-Server Architecture
      *Docker is a PAAS(Platform as a Service)
